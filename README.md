This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this game, the user plays against the computer by selecting one of three choices: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined based on the following rules:

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock

## Features

- The user can select one of three choices: rock, paper, or scissors.
- The computer generates a random selection.
- The game determines the winner based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors.

## Python Features Used

- `random()` module for generating a random number.
- `if-elif-else` statements for determining the winner based on the user and computer selections.
- `input()` function for getting user input.
